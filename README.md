# End-to-End Azure Data Factory Pipelines

## Overview
This project demonstrates a complete, production-oriented implementation of Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipelines for data ingestion, transformation, and orchestration.

It covers both batch and real-time scenarios and showcases how ADF is used in enterprise data platforms to manage complex workflows.

---

## Architecture
- Azure Data Factory orchestrates data movement and transformations
- Azure Data Lake Storage used as landing zone
- Supports SQL, REST APIs, and file-based sources
- Parameterized and reusable pipeline design

---

## Tech Stack
- Azure Data Factory
- Azure Data Lake Storage
- REST APIs
- SQL
- Azure Portal

---

## Core ADF Concepts Implemented
- Linked Services & Datasets
- Copy Activity (Batch & REST API)
- Get Metadata Activity
- IF Conditions
- ForEach Loops
- Parameterized Pipelines
- Expression Builder
- Variables & Set Variable Activity
- Data Flows for transformations
- Execute Pipeline Activity
- Debugging & Monitoring

---

## Triggers & Automation
- Schedule Triggers
- Storage Event Triggers
- Real-time ingestion scenarios
- End-to-end pipeline execution automation

---

## Data Transformation
- Transformations using ADF Data Flows
- Schema mapping and cleansing
- Conditional and dynamic processing logic

---

## Key Features
- End-to-end ingestion pipelines
- Dynamic and parameterized workflows
- REST API ingestion
- Real-time and batch processing
- Enterprise-grade orchestration patterns

---

## What I Learned
